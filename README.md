* Original tutorials are transported to Google Colab.
* [cv2workaround module](https://github.com/TakahiroDoi/opencv-workaround-for-colab) is imported to use cv2.imshow on Google Colab.
* I uploaded example image files to my Google Drive so that they can be easily read into Colab notebooks.

This is the code repository for [Hands-On Computer Vision with OpenCV 4, Keras and TensorFlow 2 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/data/hands-on-computer-vision-with-opencv-4-keras-and-tensorflow-2-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Do you want to understand how computers see images and videos? Using artificial intelligence, we can enable computers and smart devices to interpret what is in an image (computer vision).

This can provide massive benefits when it comes to automating tasks for which images are vital, such as examining medical images or enabling self-driving cars to see. Already, these applications are creating a massive industry around computer vision—one that is set to grow rapidly, with some sources predicting that it will be worth over $43 billion by 2023.

This course provides you with a perfect foundation from which to understand computer vision and supports your professional development in this fast-growing arena. We first learn the basic concepts and explore these using OpenCV4, the most popular open-source computer vision library. Next, we explore using Machine Learning in computer vision, including the use of deep learning (using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras) to implement advanced image classifiers.

This course is designed to help data scientists, and those who already have some familiarity with ML and DL (and experience with Python, Keras, and TensorFlow), to gain a solid understanding of OpenCV and train their own computer vision deep learning models.
